# Maximum-Likelihood-Estimation
Consider a signal denoted as x[n], which is defined as $x[n] = cos(2π{f_₀}n) + w[n]$, where n takes values from 0 to N-1. $w[n]$ represents white Gaussian noise (WGN) with a variance of $\sigma^2$. 
It is possible to minimize the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) while simultaneously maximizing the term mentioned in the computations below:

# Simulation
By utilizing Monte Carlo (MC) simulation as an initial approach, we can generate a plot showcasing the varying possibilities of the mentioned term within the range of 0 to 0.5. Through this simulation, we can observe that at $f = 0.25$, mentioned function attains its maximum value.
